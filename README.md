# Computer Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine (CENACE)

The name CENACE originated from the 1961 [MENACE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchbox_Educable_Noughts_and_Crosses_Engine) reinforcement learning model by Donald Michie.
I have programmed CENACE as a computer simulation of Michie's MENACE (Matchbox Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine).

Instead of matchboxes, CENACE uses folders and text files to keep track of its moves.
